Xcode Custom Templates
======================

Use these custom templates when creating new files in Xcode.
They leave out the comment headers at the top of files.


Installation
------------

    cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode
    git clone https://github.com/acani/xcode-custom-templates.git Templates

Now, when you create a new file in Xcode, you should see "My Cocoa Touch" &
"My Core Data" template groups.
